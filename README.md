Mobile fast text reader

A fast, no-frills, one-word-at-a-time reader built for phones. Add it to your Home Screen and it launches like a real app—fullscreen, offline-ready, touch-first, and distraction-free. No accounts. No cloud. Just open, paste, and read.

What it does (simple)

Paste or drop text and read it one word at a time at your pace (WPM slider + numeric input).

Tap to play/pause, swipe left/right to nudge words.

Fullscreen “cinema” mode for pure focus (Shift+Enter also works on keyboards).

Optional file input supports .txt, and processes PDFs/EPUBs entirely on-device.

Adjustable text size and brightness so it’s clean on any screen.

Why it’s great on phones

Add to Home Screen → opens standalone (no browser chrome), feels like a native app.

Offline after first load (service worker caching).

Big, responsive type and smooth transitions that get out of the way.

Controls

Swipe — Next / Previous word

Space — Play / Pause (if a keyboard is attached)
